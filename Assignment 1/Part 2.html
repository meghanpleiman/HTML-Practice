		<p1>My name is Meghan and I am a Computer Science major. I attend Ball State University. I am currently a senior. I love coding and seeing the finished products.
		</p1><br>
		<p2> I have three dogs at home. A two year old wiener dog named Axel. An eight month od Italian Greyhound named Duke. A six month old wiener dog named Oscar. We just got the two puppies at the end of July.
		</p2><br>
		<p3> I am originally from Ohio. But I have now lived in Indiana for over ten years. In two different towns in two totally different parts of the state.
		</p3><br>
		<p1> I love to read. But I don't get to do it much right now because school takes over most of my time. I didn't get to over the summer either because I had an internship. Hopefully on school breaks I can read more.
		</p1><br>
		<p2> My internship was at Precision Strip in Minster, Ohio. It was pretty fun. I coded programs that are actually used in production now. I also got to author a few of them. It was a really good experience, even though it meant moving away from my boyfriend and family for three months.
		</p2><br>
		<p3> This is just a part of who I am. I didn't know what else to type for these paragraphs but this seems to work. Hopefully I do well on this project because web development is very interesting to me. This is the first that I've ever learned about it and coded it.
